# Dynamic Pricing of Airline Tickets with Q-learning

## üìù Project Description
This project implements a dynamic pricing system for airline tickets using the **Q-learning** algorithm, a method of Reinforcement Learning (RL). The goal is to optimize ticket prices in real-time based on demand, market trends, seasons, and other relevant factors, in order to maximize revenue while maintaining a high occupancy rate.

## üéØ Objectives
- **Revenue Optimization**: Adjust prices to maximize profits.
- **Demand Consideration**: Adapt prices based on real-time demand.
- **Realistic Simulation**: Create a simulation environment that closely resembles actual market conditions in the airline industry.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Use the Q-learning algorithm to train a model capable of making optimal pricing decisions.
